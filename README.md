# Heart_Attack_Detection-PCG-ECG-Normalization

This repository contains preprocessing and normalization code for **ECG (Electrocardiogram)** and **PCG (Phonocardiogram)** signals used in heart attack and cardiac abnormality detection.

The goal is to clean, normalize, and standardize 1D biomedical signals so they are ready for **machine learning and deep learning models**.

## Features
- ECG and PCG signal normalization  
- Noise and baseline drift removal  
- Signal scaling for model stability  
- Preparation for classification or signal translation tasks  

## Use Cases
- Heart attack detection  
- Cardiac disease classification  
- ECG–PCG paired or unpaired learning pipelines
